# Module 6: Spatial Data

We introduce methods for working with spatial data, including working with vectors and rasters, projection, geometric operations, spatial joins, web mapping, and spatial indexing.

For an example of working with PostGIS, you might be interested in [this repo](https://github.com/gboeing/ms-bldg-footprints).
